### CPSC 120

* Lab 6

    In lab 6 part 2, me and my partners created a playable black jack game that allowed us to input values and see what we got from it. The program would print out your total score after calculating if the values matched or not. This was one of my favorite labs because I was able to code the program, and actually see how my work can be used in real time.

* Lab 7

    For lab 7, I worked together with my lab partner in part 2 where we made a program that checked if you were allowed to park at a specific location based on your inputs. Doing lab 7 part 2 was actually pretty fun for me as it was like solving a puzzle when I was connecting real world signs, and developing programs to solve these problems. For that, Lab 7 has really taught me how to think outside the box to make programs do specific purposes.

* Lab 10

    When doing lab 10 part 2, me and my partner were stumped at first, as we were working with 2D vectors, and trying to remove them from a list. Once we finally got it working however, everything clicked and I was very proud of our work after we finished our project. Lab 10 allowed us to play with vectors, and mess around with how we were able to store different values. This lab showed me a new dimension of coding, and how much more intricate it could be.
